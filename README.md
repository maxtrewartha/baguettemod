# Baguette Mod
Welp it's a minecraft mod for 1.16.1 and it literally adds baguettes. Thats it. Its a fucking meme mod.
This adds nothing to your minecraft experience, please don't use this.

In the **very** rare event of you using this in a modpack, you can, I don't care.
This was made on the 1.16.1-32.0.24 forge mdk build in beta.

For any other questions or ideas, contact me.
